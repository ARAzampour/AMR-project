# AMR-project
In this project we aim to model decision of electrcity generators on technollogy adoption 


In this model we have a set of firms (generators) that would recieve a technology draw from an exponential distribution with a growing mean parameter. These firms would then decide to whether adopt the tecnology they've been offered with paying a fixed cost or wait for a better draw next year on the expense of getting older and having an outdated technology.
